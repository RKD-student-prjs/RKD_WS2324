## Project description

This repository contains the architecture of the "thkoeln-recommender-system" website wich is based on svelte js. Svelte js is a straightforward javascript framework to create fast web applications.


### The important part of the folder structure is as followed:

```
.
+-- public
|   +--images
+-- src
|   +-- App.svelte
|   +-- main.ts
|   +-- routes
        +-- route.svelte
    +-- components
        +-- component.svelte
    +-- data
        +-- data.js

```

- The **App.js** file contains the router, where new routes to pages are added. It also contains the head wich is used for seo optimisations.
- The **public/images** folder is used for store images and icons
- New pages, if needed, needs to be placed inside the **routes** folder
- New components, wich are the building blocks of a page, have to be added in the **components** folder and need to be imported inside the pages where there are needed.
- The data wich contains all the informations needed for the th koeln recommender system is placed inside the **data** folder. The important files inside of the folder are the cleaned_data.json and the data.js file. The data.js file imports the data from cleaned_data.json and transforms it further into the needed format. So when using the data in new pages or components always import the data from the data.js file!
